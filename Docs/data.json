He was an avid speller, as well as one of the school's clowns, a skill he would soon develop in the Royal Navy. Among the harsh rush of the autumn waves, he learned to utilize complex mechanical equipment to his advantage, which blossomed into a love of music--both melody and rhythm.

This was understandable, due to his experiences with the aforementioned supervirus and subsequent imprisonment in the machine room out of fear that it might give him super strength. It didn't, and Sandy was released from military conscription with honors, at which point he decided to diversify his musical position by releasing instrumental music--a not insignifcant undertaking that truly makes Mr. Shirely feel, as he puts it, \"like a composer.\"<\/p>\n<p>1st Dude now resides in New York City, we think.<\/p><p>\nvia <a href=\"http:\/\/astorbell.com\/?artist=stdude\">Astor Bell<\/a><br \/><\/p>"

It was on a floor below \nwhere we were living. I think Trash rehearsed there too. <br \/><br \/>\n\"We recorded with Peter's reel to reel 4 track, sharing engineering \nduties. Peter played drums and his electric piano with pedals. I played \nguitar and sang.<br \/><br \/>\n\"One day we asked Michael Morley to come over and add his guitar. This \nwas a lot of fun. He and I played together at some point, but mostly he \nlistened and added to what Peter and I had done... then we probably all \nwent over to the Empire.<br \/><br \/>\n\"While Peter and Mecca Normal were on tour in Europe, we found out that \nMatador wanted to release the album. When it came out we did a tour in \nthe USA -- Peter, me and Michael. I didn't play guitar. Peter did a solo\n set, Michael did a Gate set and when we got to Larry Crane's house in \nPortland, Oregon we recorded a bunch of stuff that ended up being on the\n second album. Peter and I recorded the other material here in \nVancouver, where we were living in the Nanaimo Street penthouse.<br \/><br \/>\n\"The tours after the release of the second album (Matador) included \nAustin to Boston, 1997. We played at a radio station just outside of DC \nin the afternoon and then drove towards NYC to play at WFMU, which was \nstill in East Orange at that time. The song in the player is from that \nset and it describes the band at that time. Peter was playing drums and \nkeyboard at the same time and I was playing guitar and singing. <br \/><br \/>\n\"WFMU-MD Brian Turner figured this was one of, or maybe even 'the best' \nlive sets ever on WFMU. Not sure why he thought that, but hey. \nEngineered by Irene Trudel -- Peacock Coal appeared on \"Even More Live \nMusic from WFMU\" compilation. <br \/><br \/>\n\"The show after WFMU was opening for Sleater Kinney at CBGB's which was a very fun show.<br \/><br \/>\n\"Following this Peter and I played NZ and Australia (late 90s) in the \nsame configuration and we recorded a third (unreleased) album with \nMichael Hill in a tiny town in NZ.<br \/><br \/>\nI\" got on a plane back to Vancouver and never saw Peter again. The last \nimage I have of him: in the airport lounge, a few other people with us, \nhe mouthed a silent farewell.\" <\/p><div style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);background-color:transparent;text-align:left;text-decoration:none;border:medium none;\"><br \/>Read more:  <a style=\"color:rgb(0,51,153);\" href=\"http:\/\/www.myspace.com\/2footflame#ixzz10NkUpNFH\">http:\/\/www.myspace.com\/2footflame#ixzz10NkUpNFH<\/a><br \/><\/div>"

Долгое время тексты и атмосфера музыки были политические и остросоциальные, что жёстко подавлялось властями на локальных концертах. Не редко приходилось менять название. Состав музыкантов так же стремительно менялся. В итоге, со временем, верх взяло творчество, которое не может основываться на политических идеях. На данный момент группа вернулась к историческому названию 25 КУСТОВ. Весь материал основан на простых внутренних переживания и эмоция, которые свойственны простому человеку.<\/p>"

Toujours sur abYssa et toujours Idm. Le ton se radicalise, les  gameboys laissent un peu la place au piano et aux clochettes, les  percussions métalliques louchent du coté de la musique industrielle. <br \/><br \/> Fin 2008 il intègre l'association bisontine Spécimen Urbain.

L'Ep \"Quelques  Siècles d'Insomnie\" sort en 12\". Au programme rythmes déstructurés,  atmosphères futuristes, introspection et mélancolie synthétique nourrie  de rage bruyante.

But here we are, once again…<\/p>\n<p>Bolivia had its own record label in the mid-20th century called Mendez, pressed in La Paz. Although the examples I’ve come across were pressed poorly - with heavy, bumpy shellac and often in irregular sizes (9 3\/4″ as opposed to the standard 10″, for instance) - they were purely a Bolivian product and that counts for a lot. There seems to have been some wonderful regional music captured on Mendez, although I know next to nothing about the extent of their output or how long they existed before being bought up by a larger entity (I do know that they pressed labels in turquoise, gold, and dark blue, as seen here).<\/p>\n<p>The mysterious ensemble known as “31 de Octubre” consisted of a couple of guitar players, at least one probably playing the <em>charango<\/em>, and a soloist on the <em>quena<\/em>, or the traditional Andean flute. This track is labeled as a <em>carnaval<\/em> (the flip side is listed as a <em>danza indigena<\/em>), also known as a <em>carnavalito<\/em>, a particular musical style of Bolivia. It is a song from the Eastern part of the country, interestingly, not the Andean side. The title, Milongueros, refers to <em>Milongas (<\/em>or <em>Milonga)<\/em>, the Argentine style of music, and playing.

This is the sound of four people in a room.  It  is the sound of one person in a basement.  This is the sound of the  sacred, humble and hushed, and it is the sound of the commonplace,  raucous and celebratory.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">A shift in one’s point of view, a slight  change in the light as clouds skirt the edge of the sun, the tree tops  skitter against the skyline; grandeur becomes the mundane, and back  again.   A Weather harnesses the margin.  There’s a moon at mid-day, an  ice storm.   You might never sleep again, or you might sleep for days.   You’re as apt to gasp as you are to shrug.  You might sink through the  bottom of your shoes, or you might float away.  Stranger things happen  everyday.<\/p>"

A.C. Newman had a thrilling and prosperous life prior to 1992, but felt he needed more when he joined the Vancouver BC pop\/rock act Zumpano. They recorded two albums for Sub Pop in 1995 and 1996 before essentially dropping out of music circles, though no official breakup was ever announced. Neither grunge, post-rock, \"torch pop\" nor any of the other flavors of the day, Zumpano were highly regarded but maintained a low profile. This changed when Newman resurfaced in 2000 with The New Pornographers, a benevolent dictatorship - not unlike the American government - though one which seeks to overturn existing social structures. Now, for the first time, Newman's out on his own, and the results are predictably stunning. 'The Slow Wonder' has a beautifully open and uplifting feel, even as its lyrics often subvert the sunny vibe. Musically, too, the melodies and arrangements take unexpected detours which give the songs more depth with each listen.<\/p>"

A recurring theme in Milton's work is an investigation of 'place' and 'presence' and the ways in which these function within the representational realm of recorded sound. With releases on underground labels such as Jewelled Antler, Last Visible Dog and Celebrate Psi Phenomenon Milton's work is situated at some weird junction between electroacoustic composition, folk music, and the more psychedelic end of the 'noise' spectrum... Using predominantly analogue sources (tape loops, field recordings, amplified resonant objects, voice and guitar) Milton's performances have a high degree of intimacy and commonly range from the gestural and nuanced through to the visceral and ecstatic.<\/p>"

Also most of our artists we knew only on a digital, virtual basis. That’s a shame, we thought. We wanted to change that and not only meet all these wonderful people whose music we put in the interwebs, but also bring them together. So we came up with this crazy idea of renting a house somewhere nice, inviting all of them to come and bring their instruments and spend a week jamming, recording and getting to know us and each other.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 24px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; text-align: justify;\"><iframe style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent;\" src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/H4twPqvr0E0\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"500\" height=\"305\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 24px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; text-align: justify;\">It took us almost a year to put this idea into practice. <a style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent; color: #191919; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;\" href=\"http:\/\/www.aaahh-records.net\/2011\/09\/04\/denmaaahhrk\/\">In September 2011 we finally did it<\/a>. Most of the aaahh records family made it to our cosy residence and it was a wonderful week in a country that we renamed into Denmaaahhrk for a week. As a result of this week (that we as a label spent with cooking, cleaning and being wonderful moms and dads) our artists created 15 songs, that we offer you not only as a free download, but also on a limited vinyl look CD that comes in a handmade digipack. We attached two photographs to each CD and the first 20 CDs come with a mini DVD that features two videos we made during the week.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 24px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; text-align: justify;\"><iframe style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent;\" src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/PLH_wIdobgY\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"500\" height=\"305\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 24px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; text-align: justify;\">We hope that this compilation somehow reflects this wonderful week we had and we hope that you like it as much as we do. We also hope that you feel like supporting this project, because we want to do this again, maybe even this fall in 2012. One big house, one full week of music, one wonderful compilation.<\/p>\n<div> <\/div>"

      "description" : "<p><span style=\"font-family:Helvetica;color:#443e42;font-size:x-small;\">Aaron Siegel is            a composer and percussionist who writes experimental music that lies            at the intersection of abstraction and intuition. He produces concert            events and recordings involving his own music and collaborations with            other members of the experimental arts community. His work ranges from            solo compositions and chamber music to improvised ensembles and collaborative            theater pieces. <br \/><br \/> Siegel’s music has been presented by Roulette, The Chocolate Factory,            Ulrichsberg Kaleidaphon, Wet Ink Musics and AugustArt. Other works have            been performed at the Friends Meetinghouse in Manhattan, the Corcoran            Gallery of Art in Washington, DC, and the Chashama Art Space in Times            Square. Siegel’s music has been performed by the Flux String Quartet,            pianist Emily Manzo, the Kyklos Ensemble, and the Aaron Siegel Ensemble.            In the spring of 2007 the New York-based mixed chamber ensemble Till            by Turning commissioned and performed Chalk Line (for piano, bassoon,            violin, viola and cello). In April 2008, Siegel premiered The Swan Catchers,            commissioned by the Jerome Foundation for the Flux String Quartet and            4 actors at the Chocolate Factory Theater in Long Island City. He is            currently working on a commission for multiple timpanists for the online            record label Shsk’h.<br \/><br \/> His work has been supported by grants from Meet the Composer, The American            Composers Forum, The Jerome Foundation, the Aaron Copland Fund for Music,            The American Music Center, Wesleyan University, and by the Consulate            General of Argentina. He has presented his work at the Cybersonica Festival            of Sound and Art in London, UK, the Art Academy in Dusseldorf, Germany            and the University for Art and Design in Karlsruhe, Germany. Siegel            has studied with Nora Davenport, Stephen Rush, Alvin Lucier, Ron Kuivila,            Anthony Braxton and Bunita Marcus. He has an MA in composition from            Wesleyan University.<br \/><br \/> Aaron has shared the stage as a percussionist with Anthony Braxton,            Scott Rosenberg, Jessica Pavone, Stephen Rush, Andrew Raffo Dewar, Jason            Roebke, Nate Wooley, Ben Hall, Matthew Welch, Taylor Ho Bynum, Sean            Meehan, John Zorn and others. He is a member of Memorize the Sky, The            Anthony Braxton Sextet, White, Blue, Yellow and Clouds, Assembly and            his own group, Where from Here. In 2006, he founded the Aaron Siegel            Ensemble, a New York-based group that performs his music in concert            and on recordings. As part of these and other ensembles, Aaron has toured            extensively in the United States and Europe. <br \/><br \/> In September 2007, Brooklyn-based Peacock Recordings released the first            recording of the Aaron Siegel Ensemble, Every Morning, A History, which            was praised by Signal to Noise as being representative of the flowering            DIY chamber music scene in Brooklyn. 2007 also saw the release of the            self-titled Memorize the Sky (2007, 482 Music) that documents a collaboration            with Zach Wallace and Matt Bauder. The Cabinet, a solo percussion CD            (2006, Longbox Recordings) was praised by The Wire in as “an exquisite            set that has a meditative ease and grace.” He has released limited            edition CDs of his electronic music including Rooms and Spaces and Sounding            Place. His playing is featured on several recordings with Anthony Braxton            including the mammoth 9-CD Box Set, 9 Compositions (Iridium) 2006. One            of his tape pieces was selected to be part of a compilation entitled            A Call for Silence that was curated by the London-based Sonic Arts Network.            Forthcoming 2008 recordings include a live recording from Memorize the            Sky on Clean Feed Records and a trio recording featuring Bill Dixon            and Ben Hall on Broken Research.<br \/><br \/> Aaron is on the staff of the Weill Music Institute at Carnegie Hall.            He lives in Brooklyn, NY with his wife and son. <\/span><span style=\"font-family:Helvetica;color:#443e42;font-size:x-small;\"><br \/><\/span><\/p>"

He was born Artimus Alexander Pace, June 21st, 1983, in Jacksonville, Florida. At the time of his birth, his father was the drummer for the Jimmie Van Zant Band. After quitting the band, his father moved the family back to his home town of Mobile, Alabama. Much of Artimus's early life consisted of going to his father's rock shows as well as local and national concerts. As Artimus grew older, he started playing in different bands including his first serious endeavor Fry Cook. After nearly ten years of Fry Cook, the band called it quits in 2006 due to unresolved issues. Artimus then formed the first incarnation of what would become Abstract Artimus. Their first show was as a supporting act for Gwar. Several successful shows were played and an EP was recorded, but after the other members quit to pursue the family life, Artimus had to devise a new plan. He went on to write and perform as a one man band with random musicians joining him over the years. In 2009, after the release of \"God is Mad\" he added a backing band and an extensive European and North American tour followed. Abstract Artimus has toured the US, Canada and Europe both as a one man band and with his backing band which consists of a revolving door of musicians. He is currently touring and writing music at a constant pace. He has released several albums independently and on various independent labels in the U.S. and Europe. His last album, \"Barba de Dendritas\" was released in early 2010 on Arizona based Liberal Squid Records. An extensive European and North American tour followed, as did with the 2009 release of \"God is Mad\". In January 2011 select AA albums were re released on Pace's own Dire Life Records. Abstract Artimus has recently finished his new album \"RITE OF PASSAGE\" and a September 6, 2011 release on Dire Life Records has been announced.\"<\/p><p> \n~ <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wix.com\/abstractartimus\/abstract-artimus#%21__bio\" target=\"_self\">Abstract Artimus's bio<\/a><br \/><\/p>"

Bush bombed the fuck out of their home city of Baghdad and killed a lot of their family and friends. <br \/><br \/>In the resulting American occupation even more friends and family were killed. Their practice space was blown to bits and they started to receive threats from the death squads that roamed the streets. <br \/><br \/>After leaving everything behind, they were forced to live like refugees running from Baghdad to Syria to Turkey. Several months, people, and filled-out forms later, the band finally arrived in New York, where they recorded the music you hold here in your hands. <br \/><br \/>Acrassicauda met the band Testament backstage at a concert in Turkey, and when they arrived in the United States, found a mentor in Alex Skolnick, lead guitarist, who helped them practice and get ready to record their first EP. <br \/><br \/>But it wasn’t just individuals who helped the band settle down in the United States, stop running, and finally get back to making music. Companies like ESP, Peavey, Guitar Center, and Yamaha donated gear to Acrassicauda.<br \/><br \/>Inspired by the carnage of the least seven years of their lives, the tracks that are Only the Dead See the End of the War were produced by Alex Skolnick, engineered by Josh Wilbur (Lamb of God, Hatebreed, System of a Down), and co-produced by Nik Chinboukas at Spin Studios in Long Island City. Drawing from their love of Black Album-era Metallica, Slayer, and Sepultura, Acrassicauda have made a record that doesn’t sound like any other metal band out there. These are the bands that gave them the inspiration to continue on until they were able to make their music freely, but Acrassicauda has made an EP of songs that are all their own. <br \/><br \/>Like a wounded lion roaring in pain, every note and every riff of these songs is born from pain, agony, and strife and that can only stem from the experiences that they themselves lived. But just as they’ve lived their lives in the last seven years, Acrassicauda transcend mere negativity to make a beautiful, angrily hopeful record that’s as real as it comes.<\/span><\/p>"

      "description" : "<p>Action Will Be Taken formed in 1995 as a result of keen observation. It was an observation of a hardcore punk scene that was in a way, a contradiction. They were noticing sub-divisions and cliques. It was drunk punks, straight edge, skin heads, politics, anti-politics, art, artists… there was even people with long hair performing at shows and the audience yelling “hippie, get a haircut”!<\/p>\n<p>The whole scene was started on the basis of not feeling like an outcast and having a sense of family. It started to become who you know, how high your Mohawk is, etc. There seemed to almost be a dress code. There were scenesters coming to promote friend’s bands and leave after they were done. They were shunning anything new and not supporting all bands. Although the intention of music scenes are created to unify and the common denominator is music, things were slipping.<\/p>\n<p>Action Will Be Taken were a tornado of truth. Who cares about anything except the truth and in finding the truth, it calls for asking questions. They felt anger and frustration. Thousands of years of history and religious beliefs and the zombies all that it was producing even fell within the sanctity of the hardcore\/punk scene on all different levels, obviously. The band didn’t care about photos or press. Just write songs, play shows, release a 7inch and inject a new sense of self into the scene. They played with the likes of Wrecking Crew and Madball. They were always asked “where the fuck did you guys come from”? They were a creation of a product of our environment and old school integrity.<\/p>\n<p>They were completely influenced by the high energy driven music of Youth of Today, Minor Threat, Iron Maiden, Agnostic Front, G.B.H., Life’s Blood, Sabbat, Judge, Jesus Christ Superstar, Sick of it All, D.R.I., Wishful Thinking, Suicidal Tendencies and No Mercy. The group did exactly what they stood for and all within one year, true to form, they were gone. Just as quickly as hitting the scene, they disappeared. They recorded an E.P. and things collided with the intensity of creating a solar system, the band never released it… until now.<\/p>"

      "description" : "<p style=\"text-align:center;\">ACTIVE CHILD is the new project from  choirboy-turned-indie pop musician Pat Grossi. His debut collection of  songs features the skilled use of various 80s-tinged synths to create  ethereal, soaring soundscapes, punctuated by crisp electronic drum  samples and handclaps. All of this lays the groundwork for Grossi’s  exquisite vocals, which, with their unearthly sound and evocative  lyrics, take on an enchanting, hymnal quality that would not be out of  place amongst the richly colored sunlight of a church’s stained-glass  interior.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"> <\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">ACTIVE CHILD’s songs are an  intriguing study in contrast. The organic elements of Grossi’s angelic  vocals and the occasional delicate strumming of a harp cast light on the  eerie darkness created by the haunting synths and cavernous  reverberating of percussion.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"> <\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Grossi cites the musical environment  in his childhood home as an early inspiration for his own desire to make  music. After participating in a school choir as a child, he joined the  Philadelphia Boys Choir at age 10. The influence of chorale singing,  along with the sensibility of non-secular music, is as apparent in  ACTIVE CHILD’s work as the influence of 80s synth pop bands like New  Order, Joy Division and Tears for Fears.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"> <\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Pitchfork Media recently reviewed the  ACTIVE CHILD track “Wilderness,” giving it a rating of 8\/10 and  comparing Grossi’s “trembling falsetto” to that of Bon Iver’s Justin  Vernon and Antony of Antony and the Johnsons. The review went on to say  that ACTIVE CHILD’s mixed-genre work “is a good example of the positive  results to be yielded from a musician straddling two disparate styles”  and “pulls from different directions but still manages to aim forward.”<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em> Curtis Lane<\/em>, the six-song debut EP was released on June 1<sup>st<\/sup> via Filter Records in the US and Merok Recordings in the UK. -- via <a title=\"artist's Website\" href=\"http:\/\/activechildmusic.com\/about\/\" target=\"_blank\">the artist's Website<\/a><\/p>"

      "description" : "<p>I am still surprised to learn that even some of my closest fellow  netaudio enthusiasts never heard the name of Hanne Adam or her musical  solo project ‘adamned.age‘. To me, Hanne is one of the most important  and creative figures of an ever evolving scene, that still hasn’t  reached it’s <br \/>limits – and so hasn’t Hanne. When I first discovered her music, I  was attracted by the fine sound design art that runs through all of her  works. While cold at first glance, all her compositions are never  repellent, in fact they contain a common hypnotic element that opens the  door to deeper and deeper explorations that will never let you go  again. <br \/>Like every great composer Hanne is an extremely fine observer, an  attribute she also lives out in her work as a photographer. Together  with her ‘partner in crime’ Tanja Dovens, better known as ‘Die  Minimalistin’ to some lovers of fascinating drones and soundscapes, she  is a part of Berlin’s ‘Urban Exploration’ scene, where she haunts in  abandoned places in the eastern part of the city, which by now haven’t  been found by investors or carpetbaggers to turn those pearls into money  making appartments or expensive spas for the upper class of Germany’s  lavish reborn capital. <br \/>The pictures Hanne takes as well as the feelings she carries home  convert to sounds, melodies and compositions that give these places an  everlasting memorial far beyond the mere photographic moment. <br \/>But there is another driving, darker force behind Hannes Adam’s  music and her often abstract and bleak sound design: Pain, whether  physical or emotional, has been a constant companion on her path through  life and art. “Music sometimes was the only language that gave that  pain a voice, the only thing that literally kept me in this life“, she  confessed during a conversation we had in November 2009. It is in these  precious moments of composing, of feeling that special occasion when a  very private emotion transforms into a sound, when Hanne enters into a  world without constant struggle and forgets about the defeats she  suffers against enemies she can’t win against in her real life. It might  be considered a sweet irony of her life that it is this pain, that  actually leads her to her highest artistical summits. And her wise smile  showed me she knows about this antagonism very well. <br \/>It is my pleasure to witness one of the most precious jewels of  today’s netaudio scene coming together with one of the most caring  netlabels around for the best release adamned.age had so far. Enjoy  every sound, beat and emotion this musical giant has for you.<\/p>\n<p><br \/>Thomas L. Raukamp in December 2009<\/p>"

Entre les tirs croisés noise, post-punk, indie-pop, métal, adolina tente une sortie sous le feu nourri d’une seule envie : en découdre peu importe les genres et les étiquettes qu’on leur enverra à la figure.

Peu satisfait de ce premier essai qui ne reflète que l’instabilité des années précédentes, le quatuor remet le couvert et enregistre après deux années de travail ce qui deviendra Caldeira, le second album. Sous l’impulsion de Steph (A tant rêver du roi - Pau), le groupe décidera de sortir l’album en vinyle exclusivement et cherchera d’autre partenaire pour appuyer le projet : Whosbrain (Luxembourg) et Uproar for veneration (Lille)… place à présent à leur terrain de prédilection : la scène…<br \/> <br \/> Since 1998, through evolution, line-up changes, Adolina tries to work the chaos around them and the one they generate themselves. Between noise, post-punk, indie-pop, metal crossfires, Adolina tries to come out with only one urge : fight nevermind the styles and labels thrown at their face.

There's more than a fashion statement in the comparison to America's greatest country singer, too, for Ochoa is a 'guajiro' (from the countryside) and a champion of rural Cuban styles such as son and guararcha.<\/span><br style=\"color: #262626; font-family: arial; font-size: 11px; line-height: 16px;\" \/><br style=\"color: #262626; font-family: arial; font-size: 11px; line-height: 16px;\" \/><span style=\"color: #262626; font-family: arial; font-size: 11px; line-height: 16px;\">One of the younger members of the Buena Vista Social Club, at 63, he's now become something of an elder statesman himself and has been a professional musician for almost half a century. For many years he was a regular at Santiago's famous Casa de la Trova and in 1978 he took over the leadership of Cuarteto Patria, a Cuban institution which by then had already been performing for almost 40 years. He recorded two albums with the group for the Mexican Corason label and in 1986 met the veteran singer Compay Segundo, who joined Cuarteto Patria for a time. While with the group Segundo recorded the album 'Chanchaneando' which featured the original version of 'Chan Chan'.<\/span><br style=\"color: #262626; font-family: arial; font-size: 11px; line-height: 16px;\" \/><br style=\"color: #262626; font-family: arial; font-size: 11px; line-height: 16px;\" \/><span style=\"color: #262626; font-family: arial; font-size: 11px; line-height: 16px;\">A decade after their first meeting, Ochoa and Segundo famously reunited to perform 'Chan Chan' as the opening track on the Grammy winning 'Buena Vista Social Club'. To that album Eliades also contributed lead vocals and guitar on El Cuarto de Tula, and his own guajira showcase on El Carretero. Since Buena Vista, he has recorded several fine albums under his own name including 'Cubafrica' (1998) with the great Cameroonian saxophonist Manu Dibango; 'Sublime Ilusión' (1999); 'Tributo a Cuarteto Patria' (2000) and 'Estoy Como Nunca' (2002). He continues to lead Grupo Patria and tours regularly around the world.<\/span><br style=\"color: #262626; font-family: arial; font-size: 11px; line-height: 16px;\" \/><br style=\"color: #262626; font-family: arial; font-size: 11px; line-height: 16px;\" \/><span style=\"color: #262626; font-family: arial; font-size: 11px; line-height: 16px;\">TOUMANI DIABATÉ kora (born Bamako, Mali 1965)<\/span><br style=\"color: #262626; font-family: arial; font-size: 11px; line-height: 16px;\" \/><span style=\"color: #262626; font-family: arial; font-size: 11px; line-height: 16px;\">One of the most significant musicians in Africa, Toumani Diabaté is the leading exponent of the West African harp known as the kora. Born in Bamako, he inherited his musical gifts from a long family lineage of kora masters. A child prodigy, he recorded his debut album 'Kaira' in London in 1986 at the age of 21. Playing bass, rhythm and solo simultaneously on the instrument's 21 strings, it was the first ever album of solo kora music and the start of a remarkable international career.<\/span><br style=\"color: #262626; font-family: arial; font-size: 11px; line-height: 16px;\" \/><br style=\"color: #262626; font-family: arial; font-size: 11px; line-height: 16px;\" \/><span style=\"color: #262626; font-family: arial; font-size: 11px; line-height: 16px;\">As an innovative and experimental collaborator, he recorded the two acclaimed 'Songhai' albums with the Spanish flamenco group Ketama and has worked with Damon Albarn, Björk, and the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO). His collaboration with Taj Mahal on 1999's 'Kulanjan' explored the connections between West African music and the blues and was cited by Barrack Obama as his favourite album during the presidential election campaign.<\/span><br style=\"color: #262626; font-family: arial; font-size: 11px; line-height: 16px;\" \/><br style=\"color: #262626; font-family: arial; font-size: 11px; line-height: 16px;\" \/><span style=\"color: #262626; font-family: arial; font-size: 11px; line-height: 16px;\">In the more traditional vein, he has recorded widely with most of the greatest names in Malian music, both on his own albums and as a guest on releases by singers such as Salif Keita and Kasse Mady Diabaté. In recent years, he has recorded a series of thrillingly diverse releases for World Circuit, including two albums of kora-guitar duets with Ali Farka Touré, including the Grammy winning 'In the Heart of the Moon' (2004); 'Boulevard de l¹Indépendance' (2005) with his groundbreaking Symmetric Orchestra; and the acoustic solo kora collection 'The Mandé Variations' (2008).<\/span><br style=\"color: #262626; font-family: arial; font-size: 11px; line-height: 16px;\" \/><br style=\"color: #262626; font-family: arial; font-size: 11px; line-height: 16px;\" \/><span style=\"color: #262626; font-family: arial; font-size: 11px; line-height: 16px;\">BASSEKOU KOUYATE ngoni (born Garana, Mali 1966)<\/span><br style=\"color: #262626; font-family: arial; font-size: 11px; line-height: 16px;\" \/><span style=\"color: #262626; font-family: arial; font-size: 11px; line-height: 16px;\">Descended from a long line of griots, Bassekou Kouyate was born in the Segu region of Mali, where his mother was a famous singer and his father was a celebrated player of the ngoni ba, (banjo-like lute) on the local wedding party circuit. At the age of 16, Bassekou took his father's place and by the end of the 1980s he had joined Toumani Diabaté's Symmetric Orchestra.<\/span><br style=\"color: #262626; font-family: arial; font-size: 11px; line-height: 16px;\" \/><br style=\"color: #262626; font-family: arial; font-size: 11px; line-height: 16px;\" \/><span style=\"color: #262626; font-family: arial; font-size: 11px; line-height: 16px;\">Since then he has revolutionised the playing of the ngoni (an instrument dating back to the fourteenth century), adding extra strings to give him a wider melodic range and inventing new plucking methods to allow faster runs and more versatility. He also became the first ngoni player to use the instrument like a guitar, performing standing, instead of in the traditional seated position. As an accompanist, he went on to record with a wide variety of performers, including Taj Mahal, Ali Farka Touré, and the second Songhai album, before forming the ngoni quartet Ngoni Ba and making his debut as a band leader on 'Segu Blue', which won the 2007 BBC Radio 3 Award for World Music as best album. He followed it in 2009 with a second album, 'I Speak Fula', which was similarly praised, and he's very much in demand on the live circuit, as well as being an important collaborator with Africa Express.<\/span><br style=\"color: #262626; font-family: arial; font-size: 11px; line-height: 16px;\" \/><br style=\"color: #262626; font-family: arial; font-size: 11px; line-height: 16px;\" \/><span style=\"color: #262626; font-family: arial; font-size: 11px; line-height: 16px;\">KASSE MADY DIABATÉ vocals (born Kangaba, Mali 1949)<\/span><br style=\"color: #262626; font-family: arial; font-size: 11px; line-height: 16px;\" \/><span style=\"color: #262626; font-family: arial; font-size: 11px; line-height: 16px;\">Now in his early 60s, the veteran griot singer Kasse Mady Diabaté began performing with the Super Mandé orchestra more than 40 years ago. He went on to become lead vocalist with National Badema (previously known as Las Maravillas de Mali). The band originally consisted of Malian musicians who had been sent to Cuba by the Mali government to train in Havana's music conservatoires. After nearly eight years there, they returned home to find Mali under a policy of cultural authenticity under which the Maravillas were encouraged to develop a more indigenous rather than Cuban repertoire, and to take a Malian name, thus becoming National Badema (national family). And to help them create a more local sound, they recruited the traditional griot singer Kasse Mady, although their sound remained infused with a strong Cuban flavour.<\/span><br style=\"color: #262626; font-family: arial; font-size: 11px; line-height: 16px;\" \/><br style=\"color: #262626; font-family: arial; font-size: 11px; line-height: 16px;\" \/><span style=\"color: #262626; font-family: arial; font-size: 11px; line-height: 16px;\">He recorded his debut solo album 'Fode' in Paris, in 1989. An electric, dance-based recording produced by Ibrahima Sylla, he followed it a year later with a contrasting album of acoustic griot songs, 'Kela Tradition' (1990). He also sang on the fusion album 'Songhai 2' (1995) with Ketama and Toumani Diabaté. After almost a decade in Paris, he returned to Mali in 1998 and joined Taj Mahal, Toumani Diabaté and Bassekou Kouyate on the recording of 'Kulanjan' and became lead vocalist with Toumani's Symmetric Orchestra on the 2006 album, 'Boulevard de l'Indépendance'. AfroCubism is not the first time he has worked with Cuban musicians, for the late Buena Vista Social Club star Cachaíto López guested on his 2003 solo album 'Kassi Kasse'. His most recent solo album 'Manden Djeli Kan' appeared in 2009.<\/span><br style=\"color: #262626; font-family: arial; font-size: 11px; line-height: 16px;\" \/><br style=\"color: #262626; font-family: arial; font-size: 11px; line-height: 16px;\" \/><span style=\"color: #262626; font-family: arial; font-size: 11px; line-height: 16px;\">DJELIMADY TOUNKARA guitars (born Kita, Mali in 1947)<\/span><br style=\"color: #262626; font-family: arial; font-size: 11px; line-height: 16px;\" \/><span style=\"color: #262626; font-family: arial; font-size: 11px; line-height: 16px;\">Arguably the finest guitarist in Africa, Djelimady Tounkara was born in Kita and grew up playing drums and the xalam (lute). His parents wanted him to become an Islamic cleric but the plan was abandoned as soon as he saw and heard his first guitar. After early success playing in the Kita regional; band, by the mid-1960s he had moved to Bamako, where he joined Misra Jazz before he was promoted to join the state-sponsored Orchestre National as rhythm guitarist.<\/span><br style=\"color: #262626; font-family: arial; font-size: 11px; line-height: 16px;\" \/><br style=\"color: #262626; font-family: arial; font-size: 11px; line-height: 16px;\" \/><span style=\"color: #262626; font-family: arial; font-size: 11px; line-height: 16px;\">After the orchestra was disbanded, he joined the now legendary Rail Band in the early 1970s in what became known as their second period, playing at the Buffet Hotel de la Gare, next to Bamako's train station in a line up that included the singers Salif Keita and Mory Kante. He remained the Rail Band's arranger and lead guitarist throughout its glory years and in its later revival as the Super Rail Band, and continues to perform with them in Bamako to this day. In addition to appearing on all the Rail Band's recordings, he has also released the solo acoustic albums, 'Sigui' (2001) and 'Solon Kono' (2006) and 'Big String Theory' (2002) with his trio Bajourou.<\/span><br style=\"color: #262626; font-family: arial; font-size: 11px; line-height: 16px;\" \/><br style=\"color: #262626; font-family: arial; font-size: 11px; line-height: 16px;\" \/><span style=\"color: #262626; font-family: arial; font-size: 11px; line-height: 16px;\">FODE LASSANA DIABATÉ balafon (born Conakry, Guinea, 1971)<\/span><br style=\"color: #262626; font-family: arial; font-size: 11px; line-height: 16px;\" \/><span style=\"color: #262626; font-family: arial; font-size: 11px; line-height: 16px;\">Lassana Diabaté is recognised as the outstanding balafon (ancestor of marimba) player of his generation. Born in Guinea into a family of virtuoso balafon players, he grew up studying the instrument in the country's traditional style before moving to Mali where he took advantage of the greater freedom with which the balafon is played there. He became a protégé of the great Kélétigui Diabaté from whom he learned the technique of playing two balafons simultaneously, the additional instrument possessing the equivalent of the black keys on the piano.<\/span><br style=\"color: #262626; font-family: arial; font-size: 11px; line-height: 16px;\" \/><br style=\"color: #262626; font-family: arial; font-size: 11px; line-height: 16px;\" \/><span style=\"color: #262626; font-family: arial; font-size: 11px; line-height: 16px;\">He has appeared on albums by Salif Keita, Bassekou Kouyate, and Kasse Mady Diabaté among others, and has been a long-standing member of Toumani Diabaté's Symmetric Orchestra.

After all, the band was thrown together on a week's notice for their inaugural gig. St. Hubert, their 2003 debut recording, was self-financed, self-produced, and self-released. Yet it cracked numerous Canadian campus radio top 20 play lists, got them invited to roots music festivals, was spotlighted on several CBC radio shows, garnered them an appearance on Much Music despite that they don’t fit the demographic audience’s tastes, and, consequently, gave them the incentive to record a follow-up, Fighting and Onions. The Delta blues and mountain music still flows with a ferocity and menace of its early practitioners, but they are warped in a way that bucks at mere traditionalism or quaint stereotyping. Slide guitar and banjo collide with a clanging drum kit bolstered by the weighty resonance of a stand-up bass. Devil’s music? Sure…if they believed in that mumbo-jumbo…maybe.

He lives in the Yellow Springs under the earth in a huge castle all covered in silver and gold, rosy pearls and other jewels. He is the judge of the dead and notes the sins of those who are sentenced to purgatory, and decides the degree of their punishments according to Buddha’s Law. Anyone who has killed an innocent will be thrown into a boiling cauldron full of molten metal. However, if they have made a pilgrimage to each of the 33 shrines of the goddess of mercy Kannon, then all the evil they have done will disappear. Sometimes he is portrayed less pitiless and returns life to those who appear before him. On the last day of the Festival of the Dead, the sea is full of shoryobuni (“soul ships”), for on that day the high tide brings a flood of returning ghost who go back to their spirit world. The sea is luminescent with the light these souls emit, and their whispering can be heard. While the ghosts are embarking, no human ship should come near. Should one stray into the soul-covered sea, the ghosts will ask for pails. The sailors should only offer them pails without bottoms, for if they do not, the ghosts will sink their ship. Currently, Emma-o is used as a bogeyman to scare little children.” (Micha F. Lindemans, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pantheon.org\/articles\/e\/emma-o.html\">http:\/\/www.pantheon.org\/articles\/e\/emma-o.html<\/a>)<\/li>\n<li>Track 2.: Improvisation on a theme from “Ahad’s Masters Garden I.: Shapeshifting”. Rrose Selavy aka Marcel Duchamp: “Anemic Cinema” (1926) is the first part of Ahad’s film soundtrack project “AMG I.: Shapeshifting”. Duchamp’s original film is a silent movie.<\/li>\n<li> Track 3-5.: A famous Japanese Buddhist text, the Ojoyosho«, or “Essentials of Birth in the Pure Landâ was written before 986 by a monk of the Tendai sect named Genshin. The Ojoyosho« reads in many ways like Dante’s Inferno, where Genshin depicts various kinds of Buddhist hell realms, where various types of cruel and selfish actions are punished. In keeping with Buddhist theology, the hell realms are not permanent states of rebirth, but one can stay there for a very, very long time before being reborn again. “The Hell of Retribution and Justice”, where one dwells for 12,500,000 years for destroying life or eating meat and people here are pummeled by demons into mincemeat; “The Hell of the Black Rope”, where murderers and thieves are flogged with whips of fire and cut with burning axes; “The Hell of Unlimited Suffering”, where the worst of the worst go: Devadatta, who tried to kill the Buddha a number of times, and split the early monastic community, is said to dwell here, but one day he too will be a Buddha though.<\/li>\n<li>Track 6.: Revelation 6:8<\/li>\n<li>Track 7.: Alexander Hammid: “The Private Life of a Cat” (1944) is the third part of Ahad’s film soundtrack project “AMG I.: Shapeshifting”.

      "description" : "<p>A <em>taxim<\/em> (<em>taksim, taqsim, takssim<\/em>), in Turkish classical music, is an improvisation played on a single instrument - but, an improvisation within the strict guidelines of a given <em>makam<\/em> (<em>maqam<\/em>), or melodic mode. You will find taxims played on the oud, the kanun, the kemençe, the ney flute, the tanbur, and other instruments including the <em>keman<\/em> - the western violin - which is featured in this week’s post. Turkish instrumentation and improvisations are very interesting to my ears, and I have been lucky to find some stellar examples.<\/p>\n<p>This elegant taxim, in the Hicaz mode (Hijaz in Arabic), was probably recorded in the late 1920s by Polydor, most likely in Istanbul, then Constantinople. It starts off being played on a single string, then to two strings, then back to one. Interestingly, it’s also over 3 minutes and 40 seconds long, which is about as much sound as you could possibly cram onto one side of a 10″ 78rpm record.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, I could find nothing on Ahmed Djewdet, except that he appeared on several other Polydor releases from the same time period.<\/p>\n<p>If you’re interested in other taxims by Turkish classical artists in the early 20th century, I would recommend the masterful works by Tanburi Cemil Bey available on several CDs on the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.traditionalcrossroads.com\/\">Traditional Crossroads<\/a> label.<\/p>\n<p>Yup, this label is the same that I used for the CD cover on November 2nd.

Yet he's best remembered today for his leading\nrole in the first (full length) talking movie ever made, <i>The Jazz Singer<\/i>,\nreleased in 1927. He starred in a series of successful musical films\nthroughout the 1930s. After a period of inactivity, his stardom\nreturned with the 1946 Oscar-winning biographical film, <i>The Jolson Story<\/i>. Larry Parks played Jolson with the songs dubbed in with Jolson’s real voice. A sequel, <i>Jolson Sings Again,<\/i> was released in 1949, and was nominated for three Oscars. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, Jolson became the first star to entertain troops overseas during World War II, and again in 1950 became the first star to perform for GIs in Korea, doing 42 shows in 16 days.<\/p>\n<p>According to the <i>St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture<\/i>, <i>\"Jolson was to jazz, blues, and ragtime what Elvis Presley was to <span class=\"mw-redirect\">rock 'n' roll<\/span>\"<\/i>. Being the first popular singer to make a spectacular \"event\" out of singing a song, he became a “<span class=\"mw-redirect\">rock star<\/span>”\nbefore the dawn of rock music. His specialty was building stage runways\nextending out into the audience. He would run up and down the runway\nand across the stage, <i>\"teasing, cajoling, and thrilling the audience\"<\/i>, often stopping to sing to individual members, all the while the <i>\"perspiration would be pouring from his face, and the entire audience would get caught up in the ecstasy of his performance\"<\/i>.<\/p>\n<p>He enjoyed performing in blackface\nmakeup – a theatrical convention in the early 20th century. With his\nunique and dynamic style of singing black music, like jazz and blues,\nhe was later credited with single-handedly introducing <span class=\"mw-redirect\">African-American<\/span> music to white audiences.<sup id=\"cite_ref-PBS_0-1\" class=\"reference\"><span><\/span><span><\/span><\/sup> As early as 1911 he became known for fighting against anti-black discrimination on Broadway. Jolson's well-known theatrics and his promotion of equality on Broadway helped pave the way for many black performers, playwrights, and songwriters, including Cab Calloway, Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Fats Waller, and Ethel Waters.<\/p><p>- <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Al_Jolson\">Wikipedia<\/a><br \/><\/p>"

      "name" : "Albert Beger",
      "description" : "<p class=\"simpletxt\">Born in Turkey in 1959 and raised in Israel, Albert Beger’s musical sensibilities were informed from a young age by the vast cultural melting pot that surrounded him. The deeply diverse and eclectic range of sounds he heard offered a rich musical landscape upon which to draw continuing inspiration – a colorful palette of melody, harmony and rhythm that would impact his future direction as a composer and improviser.<br \/><br \/>Albert’s eclectic tastes are evident in his own compositions. Listening to his energetic, soulful pieces one hears a confluence of styles. A “World Music” that the term “world music” simply doesn’t do justice to – bebop, hard bop and free jazz, contemporary classical and ethnic music, progressive rock and electronica – delivered in an indefinable style that is pure Albert Beger. <br \/>And of course there’s that sound: free of border or limitations…a spark reaching beyond to grasp the fire of the Divine …a fearless, joyful noise that embraces experimentalism and tradition, and lyricism and frenzy, with equal passion, love and respect. <br \/><br \/>Albert has spent years wood-shedding his instrument, a reflection of his penchant for self-discipline and auto-didactic study and an uncanny love for the saxophone and its seemingly endless aural possibilities. His formal education consists of a BA earned in Composition and Performance from the Berklee College of Music in Boston and a Masters in Music from the Rubin Academy of Music and Dance in Jerusalem. He currently holds teaching positions at the Rubin Academy and Haifa University and heads the Instrument and Performance Department at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.muzik.co.il\/About_us\" target=\"_blank\">Muzik<\/a> - School of Creation and Production in Tel Aviv.<\/p>\n<p><br \/>Albert Beger has recorded eight albums of original compositions since launching his professional career in 1991. He has also collaborated on numerous projects with both local and internationally acclaimed jazz musicians, playing in a wide range of challenging improvisational settings. The long list of musicians with whom he has traded riffs both on stage and in the studio include master instrumentalists such as William Parker and Hammid Drake; Harold Rubin, Asaf Sirkis and Gabriel Meyer; John Bostock, Hagi Fershtman, and Joelle Leandre; James Newton and Roman Kontzman; and composer Eric Shapira.<br \/>Albert is the recipient of the Landau Award for Performing Arts (2005) and Israel’s highest honor for musicians, the prestigious Prime Minister’s Award for Composers (2009).<\/p>\n<p>Albert's new album Peacemaker is out on Anova Music at 2010.<\/p>"

Definitely, it is all about stressing the importance of the Word at every level. <br \/>Musically, there are many differences between both sides: the cosmic Castilian-Leonese soulful from Niño for Diploide (“El Lenguaje”) against the Mediterranean R&amp;B from high scoohl gym (“La Idioma”) and the bizarre pop from low smug (“El Indivi-duo”) from Carlos Carbonell for Garbanzo. Logically, both projects are also different. Don’t let Álex Garbanzo voice and figure disable us to see the forest leaves. Although his personality and particular relationship with the microphone could make us think about a single band, the musical aspect of both proposals has different parameters, sounds and, why not, intentions. <br \/><br \/>In addition, digital version will involve some different remixes (available download in a couple of months). Nerko from “El Gremio” and Jesús Isolitics, both of them hip hop producers, will remix “El Lenguaje” from Diploide, and Javier Álvarez, ubiquitous and unexpected musician behind projects like Néboa, Fluzo, Dúo Cobra, … will remix “La Idioma” from Garbanzo.<\/span><\/p>"

He can show up with just himself and a guitar, his huge chamber rock orchestra, a lean and mean rock and roll combo, or a string quintet.

He is a composer and multidisciplinary artist working on the musicality of spoken words and unusual aspects of spoken communication, producing text-sound compositions featured in live performances, radio broadcastings and published recordings. In his work he moves across the line between sound anthropology and composition, often including translation and misunderstanding in the creative process. Field research and interviews build the basis for abstract compositions, along with electro-acoustic and acoustic collages, relational strategies, trained and untrained instrumental practices, vocal explorations and digital manipulations. Recent text sound projects include African Feedback (Errant Bodies press), the interactive speaking machine “MaskMirror” (STEIM, Kunstradio.at a.o. ) and  his own ensemble Trophies with guitar player Kenta Nagai, vocalist Christian Kesten, and drummers Morten J.Olsen and Ches Smith.

And hasn’t \nshe just - not yet 21 but already a seasoned pro, having recorded her \ndebut album aged just 17, with members of Bright Eyes, and touring with \nthe likes of Laura Marling, Mumford &amp; Sons and Brighton cult faves \nthe Willkommen Collective. “Time Travel” is the first Alessi’s Ark album\n since signing to Bella Union, where her acutely melodic and exquisitely\n tender folk-pop charms haven’t just grown; they’ve blossomed into \nsomething extraordinarily mature.<br \/><br \/>The experience of recording \n‘Time Travel’ - in Brighton’s Electric Studios with Wilkommen \nCollective’s Marcus Hamblett and at Bryn Derwen in Wales with David \nWrench (Beth Orton, Bat for Lashes) - gave the album its name. “In \nBrighton, we did 12 hour days and had no idea what was going on in the \noutside world. In Wales, there was no phone signal, and it felt far away\n from everything.”<br \/><br \/>The 12-track Time Travel alternates between \nanxiety and joy, between childlike wishes and grown-up truths - how \nchange can force us apart but also signify growth. Intimacy is the key \nnot just to Time Travel’s sound but also its soul. “This is a collection\n of songs that have mostly grown from travelling and touring, away from \nthe familiarity of home, family and friends”.<\/p><p>From: <a title=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/alessisarkofficial?sk=info\" href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/alessisarkofficial?sk=info\">http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/alessisarkofficial?sk=info<\/a><br \/><\/p>"

Murdoch's debut cemented him as a Top Ten Artist to Watch \nin Rolling Stone, gained him five stars from Alternative Press, and was \nhailed as \"a timeless folk-pop record that's likely to endure\" by NPR \nMusic. Fiercely independent, and supported <span class=\"text_exposed_show\">by\n a word of mouth groundswell, Murdoch chose to self-release Time Without\n Consequence. It has to date sold over 100,000 copies -- and continues \nto sell briskly almost a half decade after initial release.<br \/><br \/>Though\n his second record has had a long gestation, Murdoch's reputation as a \nserious musical force has been growing apace. With no marketing and \nlittle fanfare, his debut quietly became one of the most licensed albums\n of the decade, receiving placements in countless films and television \nshows, making Murdoch one of those rare artists who is known primarily \nfor how his music actually sounds. (He has also made multiple \nappearances on prominent radio outlets like KCRW's Morning Becomes \nEclectic, WXPN's World Café, WNYC's Soundcheck, Minnesota Public Radio's\n The Current, and Seattle's KEXP.) Most recently Murdoch was tabbed by \ndirector Sam Mendes to helm the soundtrack for the acclaimed 2009 indie \nfilm Away We Go, contributing nine songs alongside songs by the Velvet \nUnderground, Bob Dylan, George Harrison &amp; the Stranglers.<br \/><br \/>Murdoch\n tape-recorded the majority of Towards the Sun in Vancouver in a single \nnight while on tour in North America in 2009. Revisiting the tape months\n later in a basement studio in Brooklyn the arrangements were kept \npoignantly spare; calling on a small handful of local musicians, the \nrecord was finished in a few days. The result is a compellingly stark \nand raw document of quiet, visceral folk songs that are at once dark and\n immediate.\"<\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"text_exposed_show\">From: <a target=\"_self\" title=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/AlexiMurdoch?sk=info\" href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/AlexiMurdoch?sk=info\">http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/AlexiMurdoch?sk=info<\/a><br \/><\/span><\/p>"

Both have a long history in the hip-hop scene around the Pacific Northwest, both as producers and emcees – All Urban Outfield finds the two working together to create a new vocabulary and aesthetic for underground hip-hop, inspired as much by the science fiction beatdowns of Kool Keith as the raw powerviolence of Spazz.<\/span><br style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 13px;\" \/><br style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 13px;\" \/><span style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 13px;\">All Urban Outfield released CRYPTO independently in 2013.

This is the sound of graffiti-covered basements ringing to bass-heavy MPC beats; of dusty beats on tape as you traverse the decaying urban sprawl. Two emcees holding the mic with confidence despite the world's ignorant turning towards Molly-addled peace and love bullshit, ultra-capitalist fever dreams and incipient species death.<\/span><br style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 13px;\" \/><br style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 13px;\" \/><span style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 13px;\">K. Clifton's voice, deep and sonorous, provides a calm philosophical counterpoint to p.WRECKS, who rips verses from looseleaf and onto beats with a feral anger and intelligence. Deep magic, alternate timelines, poverty horrorshows and spiritual malfeasance are their subject matter. The lost art of trading intelligent verses over beats without hope of celebrity, free drugs or blowjobs is their method. Drawing on a tradition that nods to the best of Def Jux, Rhymesayers, Doomtree and Anticon, they make hip-hop for outsiders, freaks, and kids with their hoodies pulled low over their eyes. <\/span><br style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 13px;\" \/><br style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 13px;\" \/><span style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 13px;\">Look out for limited edition All Urban Outfield art prints, coming soon. <\/span><\/p>"

Happily for Alla \nPolacca, and after almost a decade into their existence, they fit on the\n positive side of the equation. In other words, time meant for them a \nperfecting path in achieving a certain consistence to their sound. This \nis quite acknowledgeable on their first album released under no type of \ncollaboration, the exclusively theirs “We’re Metal And Fire In The \nPliers Of Time”.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>Going back a while on a “situationist” retrospective we can see that,\n during their career, Alla Polacca have suffered several line up changes\n which invariably had a direct impact on their musicality. To understand\n that, one needs only to listen to their three former releases, which \nrange from ambient forms to melancholy soundscapes and occasional rock \nexplosions on the verge of psychedelia. The coming and going of band \nmembers brought to the core of the band a certain creative indefinition.\n Nevertheless, the basic essence\/concept of the group was always \npresent, holding the equilibrium and pointing towards the right \ndirection. This way, after a few digressions, Alla Polacca managed to \nfind the right route for themselves and make their songs sound the way \nthey set them out to: ambient, experimental rock with a strong emotional\n charge that balances somewhere between vernal and autumnal feels.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>What they present us now with in “We’re Metal And Fire In The Pliers \nOf Time” is an elaborate musical piece, with a natural feel to it. This \neasiness is supported on a simple and effective balancing of their usual\n creativity (the one linked to their experimental ambient rock sound) \nand a new feature, spontaneity, which brings them to explore new sounds,\n even if that search leads them, at times, to the borders of the absurd,\n as in “They’ll do without us”. It is nonetheless an absurdity that \nsounds like ingenuity (even childishness) and ends up taking us to \nstrange imaginary worlds that exist inside us. The same thing is equally\n felt in “The cold (Doubt)” or in the surprising beauty of “Last day”. \nThe changes are significant and they appear to head towards sonic worlds\n usually associated with Sonic Youth. “King of winter” and “The lie \n(Conspiracy and anticipation)” are both good examples of that, excelling\n on the exploration of experimental methods in accordance with the \ntypical basic structure of the alternative rock song.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>Alla Polacca let themselves loose and make the songs in “We’re Metal \nAnd Fire In The Pliers Of Time” sound sincere. Nothing is forced or \nmanipulated. Everything grew out of the complicity between the band \nmembers who, when together, let the best of themselves pour out without \nany kind of constraint. When that happens, the end result can only be \nconsistent and appealingly creative. Everything we can hope to get from \nmusic.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>Jorge Baldaia, 2008<\/p><div style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);background-color:transparent;text-align:left;text-decoration:none;border:medium none;\"><br \/><em>source: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.myspace.com\/allapolacca\">mySpace profile<\/a><\/em><br \/><\/div>"

      "description" : "<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Original Bush of Ghosts Track<\/strong>: “Help Me Somebody”<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Software, Equipment and Other Processes Employed in the Production of Remix:<\/strong> I did a bit of manual splicing and truncating of the samples in Goldwave, particularly with the percussion. This introduced some transients into the samples that give the beat its wonderful clickiness. I also did some sound-design in Max\/MSP, primarily with a feedback patch I wrote to interface with my Berhinger BCR2000 control surface. This patch granularizes live input, and allows me to filter and manipulate the resultant sound in real-time. I hope to post this patch to my website, though it’ll be largely useless to someone without the lovely BCR. I then imported these sounds into Frooty, where I do all my sequencing. In between these steps, I did a ton of note scribbling. I like to write little play algorithms to guide the compositional process, though they’re only half-followed. <\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Aim in Producing This Rendition of the Original Source Material<\/strong>: I decided very early to use the original samples exclusively. I’m not a purist about remixes (I’m working on a remix for Sebastian Krueger right now, and gleefully adding all sorts of new material to his already-lovely track). I suppose I just felt like being arbitrary, but ultimately the stricture helped keep the remix terse and textually coherent. Also, “Help Me Somebody” seems to me to be just one big building-up. So I gave my remix a very pared-down, ABACAB structure. Again, a totally indefensible and arbitrary move on my part, though I have been doing it a lot in my tracks lately. My track on the forthcoming LuvSound.Org compilation is another ABACAB construction, though the sound design is completely out there. It’s a fun disjunction, I think. And my stuff has been really dense lately, so I decided to try and be a bit minimalist with the remix. I wanted to do something Matthew Dear-ish. I probably ended up filling all the blank spaces with little micro-edits despite myself, though. So there are all these abstractions and pseudo-algorithms; the final product is always more a thing of happy accident than anything else. <\/p>"

      "name" : "Alpha Yaya Diallo",
      "description" : "<p>Guitarist and singer Alpha Yaya Diallo, from Guinea in West Africa, is one of the hottest acts on the current world music scene. Now based in Vancouver, Canada, he’s earned a matchless reputation internationally for the excellence of his musicianship and the excitement of his live shows – whether performing solo or with his band Bafing. Diallo is a uniquely multi-talented artist. His dexterous acoustic and electric guitar-playing, with its fluid melodic lines and compelling grooves, places him in the front ranks of African axemen. In addition he is a skilled and experienced performer on a variety of percussion instruments, and on the balafon (traditional wooden xylphone). To complete the abundance of riches Diallo writes his own compositions, and sings with a supple and beautifully modulated voice.<\/p>\n<p>By successfully uniting the traditional and the contemporary, Diallo has carved a niche for himself beside such West African luminaries as Salif Keita, Baaba Maal, Youssou N’Dour, and Ismael Lo. But, if anything, the blend of musical elements to be found in Diallo’s work is even richer and more diverse, a heritage from his childhood years.<\/p>\n<p>His father worked as a doctor-surgeon, frequently on the move with his family. Growing up in a number of regions of Guinea, Diallo was accordingly exposed to a variety of cultures, and absorbed musical traditions from the Malenke, Sousou, and his own Foulani people. In addition he spent time in neighbouring Senegal, where his mother has relatives, and picked up the popular and powerful mbalax rhythm there – as well as influences from Cape Verde and the Caribbean.<\/p>\n<p>A self-taught musician, Diallo possesses a fine ear and quickly learned how to transpose for his guitar the melodic and rhythmic patterns he heard played on indigenous Guinean instruments. He was already in great demand as a musician while at school and university, performing with such bands as The Sons of Ra’is, and Syli Authentique.<\/p>\n<p>Eventually Diallo found the opportunity to move to Europe, and became a member of Fatala – a group of West African musicians recording for Peter Gabriel’s Real World label.<\/p>\n<p>Fatala travelled widely, appearing at many festivals throughout Western Europe, including the prestigious WOMAD Festival outside London, and the Festival d’Angoulèm in France. After the band’s North American tour in 1991 Diallo decided to stay, and settled on the West Coast.<\/p>\n<p>Since then he has recorded five highly-acclaimed albums of his own compositions.<\/p>\n<p>Both the acoustic Nene on which Diallo played all the instruments, and the electric Futur were nominated for JUNO Awards- the highest accolade of the Canadian music industry. In addition Futur obtained the Music Africa Award for National Recording of the Year, and the Pacific Music Industry Award for Best World Music Album. Internationally distributed by BMG, Diallo’s The Message won the coveted JUNO in 1999 for Best Global Recording. In 2002, The Journey also won the JUNO Award for Best Global Recording, as well as The Best World Independent.<\/p>\n<p>In recent years Diallo has criss-crossed Canada and the United States, garnering rave reviews wherever he goes for his masterful performances. He’s been invited to an ever-increasing number of world music, jazz, folk, and other festivals — sharing the stage with the likes of David Lindley, Thomas Mapfumo and reggae stars Jimmy Cliff, Third World and Burning Spear.<\/p>\n<p>A documentary film about Diallo and his music was shot during a trip to Guinea, and back in Canada. Entitled The Best of Both Worlds, it was first broadcast early in 2001 on the Bravo channel, and on both the English and French CBC television.<\/p>\n<p>Diallo is increasingly recognized as one of Canada’s leading music performers in any genre. In the summer of 2003 he played a series of high-profile European festivals as part of the Canada Council-sponsored Sonic Wave tour. And in February 2004 he was a member of the hugely successful African Guitar Summit concert at Glenn Gould Studio in Toronto – with Pa Joe, Mighty Popo, Madagascar Slim, Adam Solomon, and Donné Robert. The African Guitar Summit CD has just been nominated for a JUNO.<\/p>\n<p>On his latest album Djama, which means ‘The People’ in Fulah, Diallo has taken his art to new heights, with the intricacy and precision of his guitar-playing and his soulful singing. The recording features several superb duets with fellow guitarist Karamoko Kouyaté from Mali’s legendary Rail Band.<\/p>\n<p>Diallo’s musical inheritance is something he always wants to nurture and to build upon. He never strays far from these roots, while at the same time ensuring that his performances and his albums make use of the very latest advances in music technology.<\/p>\n<p>Alpha Yaya Diallo is one of the most inspired and inspirational artists on the World Beat circuit today.

      "description" : "<p>Don't Mess With the Power Child\n\nby <a href=\"http:\/\/wfmu.org\/irwin\">Irwin Chusid<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>\nThe \"Amanda\" recordings have emerged as an unexpected cult sensation on my\nWFMU program over the past two years. The chronicles feature Amanda Whitt, a\ngrowling (think Cookie Monster), defiant pre-pubescent with a Southern twang\nspewing mayhem over 1980s breakbeats and disjointed shards of pop hits. On\nsome tracks Amanda shrieks while clanging pots &amp; pans. The recordings exude\nundeniable charm, but there's nothing cute about it. Any sentient adult\nwitnessing this behavior would commence punitive action or summon law\nenforcement.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nPower-child Amanda was recorded between 1986-89 at home in Alabama, between\nages 8 and 11, by her older (by 7 or 8 years) brother Joseph (a.k.a. Jody).\nJoseph and Amanda were a couple of hyperactive kids pretending to be,\nrespectively, a music video director and a child star. Most recordings were\ncaptured on cassette, others on video cam, in the lowest of lo-fi. The duo\nsometimes enlisted friends in the frolics, and often drove their parents\ncrazy (with incidents caught on tape). The most durable performances were\ntitled (e.g., \"The Pickle People,\" \"Horrible Hybrid Tulips,\" \"Indian Hoots\nEcho Baby,\" \"Me Swinging in Cookieland\") and compiled on \"albums,\" whose\ndesign awkwardly replicated the commercial cassette format. Inserts were\npasted up and xeroxed, and collections assigned titles (e.g., <em>Primitive\nSwagger<\/em>, <em>Monumental Whopper Turmoil Jam<\/em>, <em>Empires and 5th\nDimension Perspective<\/em>, and <em>Worship Me<\/em>). The recordings were not\ncirculated beyond friends.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nAt age 11, Amanda began to chafe at Jody's stage-brother puppeteering; she\nsoon discovered boys, and the recording project was abandoned. The tapes\nwere stored in shoe boxes in Joseph's closet, where they remained for\ndecades as forgotten adolescent artifacts.<\/p>\n<p>\nA longtime fan of WFMU and outré sonics, Joseph began to share recordings\nwith my longtime buddy and DIY legend <a href=\"http:\/\/rsteviemoore.com\">R.\nStevie Moore<\/a>. RSM layered electric guitar on one track (\"Squaw\nHootenanny\") and slipped it on one of his self-released (but typically\nunderheard) comps, where I discovered it. RSM provided the backstory and\ncompiled me two CDs of Amanda madness. I instantly fell under the spell of\nher playful chaos and, encouraged by jubilant listener reaction, became the\nradio portal for Amanda's wider notoriety. I later connected with Joseph,\nwho provided additional recordings.<\/p>\n\n<p>Joseph moved to Brooklyn about four years ago; Amanda still lives in Alabama\nand manages a BBQ restaurant (part of a family-owned chain). During Amanda's\ntrip north in July 2009, she and Jody met RSM and me for dinner in\nWilliamsburg. On a back street brownstone stoop I taped an impromptu\ninterview, which aired in two parts:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/wfmu.org\/playlists\/shows\/32267\" title=\"Irwin \/ WFMU \/ Amanda special pt1\" target=\"_blank\">\nhttp:\/\/wfmu.org\/playlists\/shows\/32267<br \/><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/wfmu.org\/playlists\/shows\/32359\" title=\"Irwin \/ WFMU \/ Amanda special pt2\" target=\"_blank\">\n\nhttp:\/\/wfmu.org\/playlists\/shows\/32359<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Amanda's singular appeal is difficult to explain. There's no artifice, and\nnothing remotely arty. At their best, the recordings are compelling in a\ncar-wreck way. At their worst, they're a couple of obnoxious brats with a\ncheap tape deck. Yet Amanda's voice conveys elusive qualities with enormous\nappeal. Her delivery is brutal, her growl unearthly; yet there's a\ntranscendent joy in her lack of inhibition. The gal has a repertoire of\nshrieks, howls, swoops and pet phrases. Most of my listeners find the\nrecordings diverting and entertaining. A few strongly dissent‹one to the\npoint of suicidal threats. You either get it or you don't.<\/p><p><\/p><p><br \/><\/p><p>[sample lyrics]<\/p><p>\"WORSHIP ME\"<\/p><p>Worship me<br \/>I am Cookie<br \/>You must worship me<br \/>Bow before MeMe<br \/>I am your idol<br \/>I am the goddess of cookie<br \/>You will worship me<br \/>Chant before me butt-slave<br \/>Come to me at the temple of MeMe<br \/>Worship me<br \/>You must worship me<br \/>Don't mess with the power child<br \/>I control you<\/p>"

      "description" : "<p>American Music Club is a San Francisco-based band led by <span class=\"mw-redirect\">singer-songwriter<\/span> Mark Eitzel.<\/p><p>Although born in California, Eitzel spent his formative years in\nOkinawa, Taiwan, Great Britain and Ohio before returning to the Bay\nArea in 1981. After a brief stint with the bands The Cowboys (one\nsingle: \"Supermarket\"\/\"Teenage Life\") and The Naked Skinnies\n(one single) he founded American Music Club in San Francisco in 1982\nwith guitarist Scott Alexander, drummer Greg Bonnell, bass player Brad\nJohnson. The band went through many personnel changes before arriving\nat a stable line up of guitarist Vudi,\nbassist Danny Pearson, keyboardist Brad Johnson, and drummer Matt\nNorelli. This lineup would change over the next several years but\nEitzel always remained the core of the band in terms of its vocals,\nlyrics and thematic focus with Vudi and Danny Pearson accompanying him on guitar and bass.<\/p>\n<p>Their 1985 debut, <i>The Restless Stranger<\/i>,\noffers a rough outline of their increasingly eclectic sound and firmly\nestablished Eitzel's worldview, a dark vision of life as seen through\nthe bottom of a shot glass. 1987's <i>Engine<\/i> honed the formula: the addition of producer Tom Mallon as a full-time member expanded the group's sonic palette.<\/p>\n<p>American Music Club earned a solid cult following on the strength of 1988's <i>California<\/i>. Their next LP, 1989's <i>United Kingdom<\/i>,\nappeared only in the nation which lent the record its name and\nconsisted of new material some of which was recorded live at the Hotel\nUtah in San Francisco.<\/p>\n<p>In 1991 American Music Club emerged with the record that is widely considered their masterpiece, <i>Everclear<\/i>.\nCritical acclaim attracted the attention of several major labels.\nRolling Stone called it the Album of the Year and called Eitzel\nSongwriter of the year. Eventually AMC -- now consisting of Eitzel, Vudi, Pearson, multi-instrumentalist Bruce Kaphan, and drummer Tim Mooney -- signed with Reprise in the U.S. and <span class=\"mw-redirect\">Virgin<\/span> throughout the rest of the world.<\/p>\n<p><i>Mercury<\/i> followed in 1993 and, despite positive reviews, <i>Mercury<\/i> fared poorly on the charts and earned virtually no recognition from radio or MTV. In 1994, AMC issued <i>San Francisco<\/i>,\nwhich balanced confessional tunes like \"Fearless\" and \"The Thorn in My\nSide Is Gone\" alongside more accessible offerings such as \"Wish the\nWorld Away,\" one of the band's biggest hits.<\/p>\n<p>The band disbanded soon after <i>San Francisco<\/i> was released and reunited in 2003 to record a new album, <i>Love Songs for Patriots<\/i>, which is described by reviewer Mark Deming as \"a stronger and more coherent effort than the group's last set, 1994's <i>San Francisco<\/i>,\nand while it's too early to tell if this is a new start or a last\nhurrah for AMC, it at least shows that their formula still yields\npotent results. Here's hoping Eitzel and Vudi have more where this came\nfrom.\" <sup id=\"cite_ref-0\" class=\"reference\"><span><\/span><span><\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n<p>On June 20, 2007, AMC announced a new lineup connected to the band's base of operations moving to Los Angeles.\nEitzel and Vudi remain, while Mooney and Pearson stayed behind in San\nFrancisco. They are replaced by bassist Sean Hoffman and drummer Steve\nDidelot. AMC's next record, entitled <i>The Golden Age<\/i>, was released in the UK on February 4, 2008 on Cooking Vinyl and in the US on Merge Records on February 19.<\/p><p>-<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/American_Music_Club\">Wikipedia<\/a><br \/><\/p>"

However, “Mating Season” is a more varied, downtempo departure from his more high-energy, alter ego The Polish Ambassador. The jumpsuit is gone and the songs exhibit a more intelligent and intricate artistry.<\/p>\n<p>The track titles are ripe with science references. And, the mixology, concoctions and cutting and splicing are evident in each track. If a science lab project and an after-hours underground party collided, it might sound like Ample Mammal. Ample Mammal is bringing his highly unique sound to the oft-times formulaic and duplicitous electronic dance genre. And, he’s poised to find his infectious dance music and live performances embraced by a larger International audience.<\/p>"

It’s Vincent’s greatest gift, and the reason that his decade of output has attracted a devoted listenership that continues to grow.<\/p><p>Andrew Vincent now lives in Toronto, hard at work on a PhD in Communication and Culture at York.

Sa musique pourrait être décrite comme  du folk post moderne soit un mélange original de sa douce voix, de  guitares acoustiques et électriques, de rhodes, flutes, saxophone et  violoncelle. Le tout agrémenté de sons de vinyls surprenants. Son album  'Teaser for: matter' - le premier à bénéficier d'une distribution  nationale -  l'imposa comme l'une des grandes révélation de l'année 2004  (classé parmi les 100 albums de l'année par le magazine Les  Inrockuptibles). Il fut ensuite à l'origine du projet The John Venture,  avec le groupe B R OAD WAY, sorti en 2006 sur le label, qui fut salué  par la critique comme l'un des meilleurs projets  hiphop-electro-indierock dans la droite lignée du son des labels  Anticon, Lex ou Defjux. En 2007, son nouvel album Oulipo Saliva voit le  jour, et finit de l'imposer comme l'un des plus originaux et doué  songwriter de France. Oulipo Saliva, album concept où les E ont été  bannis des paroles, ainsi que l'accord Mi (E en notation anglaise) de la  musique, le tout en hommage à l'Oulipo (Ouvroir de Littéerature  Potentielle) et la disparition de Georges Perec. L'album va par ailleurs  bénéficier d'une distribution internationale en 2008.

She has worked intensively in the crossover area between improvisation and composition, exploring the possibilities of the prepared guitar with regard to sound, structure, noise, the mixing of materials, and space. Various preparation methods are used to produce noises and sounds, which are then enlarged through the use of sometimes high levels of amplification. The sound of the amplification and mixing board, additional tapes, radios and objects are used as musical material. She works also in the field of electroacoustic composition, both deconstructing and reconstructing selected sound and noise material. Fragments of noises, of words and sentences are used to remind, to suggest certain meanings, fusing with the sounds in a surreal, abstract soundscape. Krebs has released a string of superb CDs in recent years, with the most recent being Sgraffito, Siyu and The Kravis Rhonn Project (duos with Robin Hayward, Toshi Nakamura and Rhodri Davies respectively).<\/p>\n<p style=\"font:normal normal normal 11px\/normal arial, verdana, sans-serif;color:#333333;margin-top:4px;line-height:14px;\">Taku Unami was born in Tokyo, Japan, in 1976. He is a composer and improviser working with assorted stringed instruments, including the guitar, mandolin, and contraguitar, laptop and vibrating objects (from which he amplifies the inaudible vibrations). Despite being linked to minimal improvisation his music is hardly classifiable, being able to surprise listeners on every new release, raising unforeseen questions and forging new paths for improvisation. He is part of the group HOSE and has active collaborations with Mattin, Taku Sugimoto and Masahiko Okura. In the past he has worked with Radu Malfatti, Jean-Luc Guionnet, Klaus Filip, Masafumi Ezaki, Burkhard Stangl, Rhodri Davies and Keith Rowe, among others. Unami has also composed for film, including 'Lost My Way' (directed by Takeshi Furusawa) and 'In 1,000,000 years' (directed by Isao Okishima). He has released more than 30 records, both solo and in numerous groups and collaborations. He runs the influential label Hibari Music and co-organizes the Tokyo concert series Chamber Music Concerts with Taku Sugimoto and Masahiko Okura.<\/p>\n"

Neely has been called \"a creative and progressively thinking artist\", whose eclectic style incorporates everything from electronica to \"John Barry-like orchestral atmospherics\".

A recurring theme in Milton's work is an investigation of 'place' and 'presence' and the ways in which these function within the representational realm of recorded sound. With releases on underground labels such as Jewelled Antler, Last Visible Dog and Celebrate Psi Phenomenon Milton's work is situated at some weird junction between electroacoustic composition, folk music, and the more psychedelic end of the 'noise' spectrum... Using predominantly analogue sources (tape loops, field recordings, amplified resonant objects, voice and guitar) Milton's performances have a high degree of intimacy and commonly range from the gestural and nuanced through to the visceral and ecstatic.<\/p>"

      "description" : "<p>It’s a long Hitchcockian zoom-in, the omniscient clouds part, the\nsleazy waterfront scene is set. Like Steve Zissou’s Belafonte\ncross-section, we can see a number of little hives of activity: a young\nman loiters behind a cramped bar; faces light by low lights listen\nintently while one speaks, gesturing wildly; a captain barks orders at\nhis crew to hurry the fuck up; someone throws flowers into the sea; a\nvintage jukebox amuses the hipsters on a crawl. Welcome to the borough\nof a possible nowhere.<br \/><br \/>Apostle of Hustle first took shape after\na two-month sojourn in El Barrio Santo Suarez, in Havana, in 2001. This\nexperience was mind blowing for Apostle of Hustle’s lead (Andrew\nWhiteman) from the ground up: the community, the fashion, the speed and\nthe music. Whiteman returned to Toronto invigorated about a possible\nmusic that did not yet exist. Knowing he wanted to create it, Whiteman\ntook up residency at a local dive as Apostle Of Hustle, a quartet. The\nband played Brazilian and Cuban folk songs, as well as Tom Waits\/PJ<br \/>Harvey\/Marc\nRibot covers. Whiteman played guitar and tres; plus he recruited Dean\nStone on drums and Julian Brown; an old buddy from the mid 90’s indie\nscene – on upright bass. The fourth position was a kind of ‘open<br \/>door’\nto whomever might show up on their nights. Anyone from Bryden Baird\n(Feist) on flugel horn to Daniel Stone (cache) on percussion.<br \/><br \/>Apostle\nof Hustle’s first endeavor, Folkloric Feel, was released in July of\n2004. It was a Frankenstein of a record – recorded in over four\ndifferent locations at different times. By this point, Whiteman was\nalmost completely consumed with recording and touring with Broken\nSocial Scene and finishing the Apostle of Hustle record could only\nhappen in between tours. A collection of tracks and mixes and ideas was\nbrought to BSS producer David Newfeld’s door and he somehow was able to\ncreate the psychedelic debut that came out on the Arts &amp; Crafts\nlabel.<br \/><br \/>National Anthem of Nowhere was recorded in Montreal at\nStudio Masterkut in March of 2006. This time around the band sought the\nproduction talents of Martin Davis Kinack (BSS\/Sam Roberts\nfront-of-house man, as well as<br \/>Sarah Harmer producer) National\nAnthem of Nowhere was finished in Whiteman’s bedroom in September and\nmixed in the woods at Marty's secret studio locale. The vibe was almost\ncompletely vin rouge, even after the Montreal stint. A few guests lurk:\nLiam O’Neil from the Stills, Evan Cranley and Chris Seligman from\nStars, Lisa Lobsinger who sang with BSS on their 2006 tours. Daniel\nStone is present on almost all the tracks playing conga, bongo, and\nespecially caja. The record sounds so good, he even decided to skip\npart of the salsa season to tour<br \/>with Apostle of Hustle in 2007. Nice one, compañero.\n    <\/p>"

      "description" : "<p>Combining the common emotional thread running through ancient British murder ballads and the more evocative music found deep in the Appalachian Mountains, Maine folk duo Arborea creates timeless music, haunted by deep shadows. Named after a species of trees, Arborea comprises Buck Curran on acoustic, slide, and electric guitars, flutes, banjo, and vocals, along with Shanti Curran, who sings lead and plays banjo, percussion, guitar, bowed strings, and ukulele. Their songs are bathed in shimmering harmonics, spectral slide, and positively spooky banjo. The songs also evoke a kind of mysterious quality, in which you are never quite sure what the songs are about, but they seem to touch a place in your soul that instinctively understands.

      "description" : "<p>Born as a recording project in its northern Maryland home studio, Arc and Sender has developed into a full-fledged band. After an initial run of hand-packaged CD-Rs quickly sold out, the trio became increasingly entrenched in recording a proper debut.<br \/><br \/>Arc and Sender’s unique sound is derived from a thick chorus of drums, guitar, and baritone guitar. Quickly shifting tempo, timbre, and texture, Arc and Sender's intricate songs maintain a dramatic tension between composition and chaos. One part Brian Eno; one part Jesus Lizard; one part Dirty Three – Arc and Sender shows a diversity in between – and inside – each track. The band’s self-titled debut includes a range of pieces – from avant-garde interstitials to hard-driving walls of sounds to placid guitar arrangements. Despite being a relatively new band, the trio is earning comparisons to similar adventurous instrumental guitar-based bands like Growing, Tarentel, and Explosions in the Sky.

The work blurs boundaries between digital and analog as well as electric and acoustic, foregrounding sound sources from out of the way places.<br \/><br \/>Using looping tools, effects pedals and real-time tape recorder manipulation, AREA C strives for the creation of subtle, textural and dynamic sounds through acts of sonic manipulation, disintegration and recombination. Improvisation also plays an important role for AREA C, with live performances often based on extended explorations of minimal thematic starting points or clusters of tone and melody.<br \/><br \/>In addition to original experimental releases and performances, AREA C also works with audio art, installations, soundtracks and sound design, collaborating with architects, filmmakers, poets and photographers. AREA C's work has been featured in the Cooper-Hewitt Design Museum, the Architectural League of New York, Sundance Film Festival, RISD Museum and Brown University.

Recorded in both Kabul and Los Angeles, Delawari's own guitar, piano, and vocal melodies are soaked in classical Afghan rhythms and echoes of Laurel Canyon rock &amp; roll. Delawari delivers a fresh and impassioned sound that exudes a universal spirit.<\/p>\n<p>Delawari's choice to record \"Lion of Panjshir\" in Afghanistan came with a phone call in February 2007: \"It was my mother from Kabul telling me that the Taliban was starting to gain power again,\" she says. As part of a reconstruction effort, Delawari's parents had returned to Afghanistan in 2002; she herself had been going back and forth since then, diligently documenting her travels in photographs and film. The call though, signaled what might be a last opportunity for her: \"At this particular moment I had a feeling that things were shifting- that I may never have the chance to record there again.\" Three months later she and her bandmates Max Guirand and Paloma Udovic found themselves at her parents house in Kabul. Under the protection of two guards (AK 47s), they recorded the album right in the Delawari household. They collaborated with three Afghan Ustads: a tabla player, a rabab, player, and an 88-year-old dilruba player, the last living master of his instrument. Under previous Taliban rule these talented musicians had once dismantled and hid their instruments due to a ban on music. Delawari and her band spent several days rehearsing and recording with them. The album was then finished in Los Angeles, featuring additional guest musicians and mixed by David Lynch. The album also includes one song \"Suspend Me\" produced by Lynch himself. The name \"Lion of Panjshir\" is an homage to the Afghan revolutionary Ahmad Shah Massoud.<\/p>\n<p>Her previous recordings include the song \"Crazy for You\", part of a Madonna tribute released by Manimal Vinyl. Delawari is also a member of the LA Ladies Choir, whose first album will be coming out soon on Teenage Teardrops. Delawari both sings and plays guitar on the album.<\/p>\n<p>Delawari is a multi-media artist; in addition to her music she is also an actress, photographer, and filmmaker. A graduate of USC Film School, she's currently co-directing a documentary about her family's involvement in Afghanistan, and the making of her album there with Emily Lynch.<\/p>\n"

Formed in 2006 in Hamilton, ON, the band recorded and released their debut EP “Deadlines” in 2007. The six songs bring the listener rock as it should be; catchy, raw and unbridled. Arkells have succeeded in blending traditional blues hooks mixed with rock heavy riffs, and a hint of soul on the side. From the strum of the first chord, the music ignites into a fury of addictive and muscular cadence, taking hold of the listener in all the right ways.<br \/><br \/> The five piece band is made up of Tim Oxford on drums, Dan Griffin on keys, Mike DeAngelis on guitar, Nick Dika on bass and Max Kerman on guitar and vocals (though all members layer their voices on most songs). In their music are threads of The Police, Springsteen and The Band, woven with a few newer rock influences such as Joel Plaskett and The National, tied together with subtle strands of classics rhythms from the Motown era. These influences create a musical textile that is rich with melodic vocals and energetic rhythms fit to get any crowd singing along and throwing their hands in the air.<br \/><br \/> Since the release of “Deadlines” the band has traveled around Ontario to share the stage with Tokyo Police Club, Matt Mays &amp; El Torpedo, Cuff the Duke, and Alexisonfire, only recently with increased touring have they traded in their Greyhound and Go bus passes for a stylish mini van. But they ain’t going to fear the New Year. No, they are taking it head on. Signed to Dine Alone Records at the beginning of 2008 (home to City and Colour, Attack in Black, Bedouin Soundclash), the band has booked shows with Ladyhawk and Danko Jones. They are set to re-release Deadlines in 2008 through Dine Alone. Until then, their music is best showcased live, so be sure to get to a show, keep your ear to the ground and add the album to your birthday list.<\/p>"

Working with many different artists and musicians, he has produced many different recordings, performances, festivals, groups and experimentations in the past years. He has helped put out music for those associated with The Whitehaus, a house in Boston, MA, known by underground music patrons and purveyors across the country. Foam has worked with many different mediums, from \"Harsh noise\" outfits including Bang! Bros. featuring Mark Johnson from Hunnie Bunnies, to the more chilled out folk of Peace, Loving, and doing interesting one off performances with groups such as Libras of Sound (with Greg Beson), utilizing a full concert venue’s sounds and light board, while doing a performance consisting of a ten minute sound check that morphs into a into a game of hide and seek, spanning the entire venue.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"color: #1a1a1a; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12px; line-height: 19px;\">In 2013, ARKM Foam released the bizarre and intense Lower Case <em>Tape\/ NoTape<\/em>, a cassette consisting of two pieces of music, created only using two tape machines connected to contact microphones. <\/span><\/p>"

guitar on “Don’t Inhale” and Brother Mathew Icklan on the Drums.<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If memory serves this band was a side project finding its footing in sound tracking bits of the mod

only played a few loose basement\/legion hall shows, once covering “Save the Earth” from Godzilla vs the Smog Monster and another at the home of Ingor Lorre (Nymphs) for a backyard 4<sup>th<\/sup> of July party with members of Shirk Circus backing up Keith Morris (Circle Jerks), in attendance two staff members of Screw Magazine.<span>  <\/span>The experience was surreal as is my memory of this band that never realized it’s full potential.<span>  <\/span>Only these recordings remain, unfinished.<span>  <\/span>Some tracks were to have vocal parts added but most the sessions seemed, at the time, to have come out under par.<span>  <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Matt, William and Mikey were a soundtrack machine and recorded many tracks for Caress of the Vampire 2, Nude Strangle and I Was a Teenage Strangler which will all soon be available on the FMA!<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"> <\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Caress 2 and I was a Teenage Strangler are available on DVD @

Sonically generous and emotionally raw, ARMS’ <em style=\"font-family:inherit;vertical-align:baseline;padding:0px;margin:0px;border:0px;\">Summer Skills <\/em>lures listeners like a siren song and then pulls them into the deep.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;font-size:13px;font-family:'Droid Serif', Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;vertical-align:baseline;line-height:18px;color:#2c2c2c;padding:0px;border:0px;\">Todd Goldstein has been writing and recording songs as ARMS since 2004 — although never quite like this. During his years playing guitar in NYC-based indie rockers Harlem Shakes, Todd quietly self-released his own music as ARMS, sneaking home-recording sessions in his rare spare time. Todd’s first album as ARMS – the luminous, ramshackle pop of <em style=\"font-family:inherit;vertical-align:baseline;padding:0px;margin:0px;border:0px;\">Kids Aflame<\/em> – was released on Melodic Records (UK) \/ Gigantic Music (US) in 2008 to enthusiastic Internet-praise. When Harlem Shakes disbanded in the summer of 2009, Goldstein expanded ARMS into a full band with the addition of Tlacael Esparza on drums, Matty Fasano on bass \/ vocals and David Harrington on keyboards \/ electronics. The group immediately began writing the songs that would become <em style=\"font-family:inherit;vertical-align:baseline;padding:0px;margin:0px;border:0px;\">Summer Skills<\/em>, holing up with producer Shane Stoneback (Vampire Weekend, Sleigh Bells, Cults, Fucked Up) in Stoneback’s Treefort Studios in Brooklyn.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;font-size:13px;font-family:'Droid Serif', Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;vertical-align:baseline;line-height:18px;color:#2c2c2c;padding:0px;border:0px;\">On <em style=\"font-family:inherit;vertical-align:baseline;padding:0px;margin:0px;border:0px;\">Summer Skills<\/em>, ARMS’ former emotional directness is abstracted and expanded into something more ambitious and ambiguous: a keenly observed fictional universe that shows more than it tells. With Stoneback behind the boards<em style=\"font-family:inherit;vertical-align:baseline;padding:0px;margin:0px;border:0px;\">,<\/em> drums pop and shimmer, analog synths cast audible shadows and ambient clouds glow on the horizon, rendering ARMS’ golden guitar pop something both lovelier and more ominous than before. Todd’s unmistakable baritone is the anchor; it swoops and slides into view, veering between vulnerable, seductive and, maybe, a little bit dangerous. The resulting noise calls to mind the atmospheric clarity of British pop experimentalists like Talk Talk or Kate Bush, with a nod to the minimalist melancholy of Red House Painters and the end-over-end urgency of early REM. But ARMS ‘ noise is all their own, taking the no-nonsense bones of tight songcraft and covering them in shining skin.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;font-size:13px;font-family:'Droid Serif', Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;vertical-align:baseline;line-height:18px;color:#2c2c2c;padding:0px;border:0px;\">Amid the life-or-death stakes of <em style=\"font-family:inherit;vertical-align:baseline;padding:0px;margin:0px;border:0px;\">Summer Skills<\/em>, noses drip kerosene, chill winds blow sweet and razor-sharp teeth gleam in the darkness. It’s this terrain of texture and mood, set among the long purple shadows of August afternoons, that underpins the album’s sequence of haunting moments — little nightmares lit with the blurry shine of dreams. With <em style=\"font-family:inherit;vertical-align:baseline;padding:0px;margin:0px;border:0px;\">Summer Skills<\/em>, ARMS manages the elusive trick of weaving these threads into something both lush and beautifully, painfully alive.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;font-size:13px;font-family:'Droid Serif', Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;vertical-align:baseline;line-height:18px;color:#2c2c2c;padding:0px;border:0px;\">ARMS has had the pleasure of sharing the stage with Walkmen, White Rabbits, Passion Pit, The Love Language, A Place to Bury Strangers, Japandroids, Braids, Hospitality, Caveman, Asobi Seksu, and more.<\/p>\n"
